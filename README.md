# Voice Assistant and Translation Service

A powerful Python-based voice assistant that combines AI-powered responses with real-time translation capabilities. The project consists of two main components: a French voice assistant using Google's Gemini AI and a multi-language translation service.

## Features

### 1. Voice Assistant (assistant_vocal.py)
- French voice recognition and text-to-speech
- AI-powered responses using Google's Gemini API
- Context-aware conversations (maintains conversation history)
- Markdown text cleaning for natural speech
- Interruptible responses
- Natural conversation flow with context retention

### 2. Translation Service (translator_assistant.py)
- Real-time French speech to text conversion
- Translation to multiple languages:
  - English (en)
  - Spanish (es)
  - German (de)
  - Italian (it)
  - Portuguese (pt)
  - Arabic (ar)
  - Chinese (zh-cn)
  - Japanese (ja)
  - Korean (ko)
  - Russian (ru)
- Text-to-speech in target language
- Interactive language selection
- Seamless audio playback

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Microphone
- Speakers/Headphones
- Internet connection

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AminePro7/Voice-Assistant-and-Translation-Service.git
cd Voice-Assistant-and-Translation-Service
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Gemini API key:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
GEMINI_API_URL=https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.0-flash:generateContent
```

## Usage

### Voice Assistant
Run the voice assistant:
```bash
python assistant_vocal.py
```
- Speak in French to interact with the AI
- Say "arrêter", "stop", "quitter", or "au revoir" to exit
- You can interrupt the assistant's response by speaking

### Translation Service
Run the translation service:
```bash
python translator_assistant.py
```
1. Select your target language from the menu (1-10)
2. Speak in French
3. The service will:
   - Convert your speech to text
   - Translate it to the selected language
   - Play the translated audio
4. Say "arrêter" to quit
